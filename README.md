## Cyber Security Threat Detection

###  Project Overview

This project uses **Machine Learning with PyTorch** to detect suspicious cybersecurity events from system log data. The goal is to classify activities as **malicious or benign** based on extracted features.

---

###  Dataset

* Labeled CSV files containing event attributes
* Target column: **`sus_label`** (0 = normal, 1 = suspicious)
* Train, validation, and test splits used for evaluation

---

###  Tech Stack

* Python
* PyTorch
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn

---

###  Workflow

1. Load and preprocess data
2. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
3. Convert data to PyTorch tensors
4. Train a neural network classifier
5. Evaluate on validation & test sets

---

###  Model Architecture

* Fully connected neural network
* Two hidden layers (ReLU activation)
* Sigmoid output for binary classification

---

###  Results

* High training accuracy
* Low test accuracy → **possible overfitting / data imbalance**

---

###  Future Improvements

* Handle class imbalance
* Feature engineering
* Try Random Forest / XGBoost
* Hyperparameter tuning

---

###  How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```
